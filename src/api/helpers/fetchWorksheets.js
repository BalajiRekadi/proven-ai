Dry in an oven at 80 ºC to 90 ºC. Cool to room temperature in a desiccator and weigh. Mix thoroughly 10 g of sample with 100 mL of isopropyl alcohol. Pour through the screen in 3 or 4 portions, tapping the screen after each portion until screened.\nNote: \tUse a total of about 400 to 500 mL of isopropyl alcohol for the washing processes that follows. Continue to wash until no more fines appear to pass through sieve.\nWash the residue with isopropyl alcohol. Brush the residue gently through the screen with a camel’s hair brush. Wash the brush carefully with isopropyl alcohol taking care that no particles cling to the brush and that no loose hairs from the brush remain on the screen. Carefully clean off any sample particles adhering to the bottom rim of the sieve. Dry the screen and residue in an oven at 80 ºC to 90 ºC for 20 min. Cool to room temperature in desiccator and weigh.\nCalculate the percentage of sample that passed through the No. 325 sieve using the formula below.\nWX - WR\nPercentage passing through the No. 325 sieve = ----------- x 100\nWX Where\nWX = The sample weight in grams\nWR = The weight in grams of sample retained on the No. 325 sieve.\nHISTORY OF CHANGES\nCCR\nNumber Supersedes (Number and last version) Change(s) Made Effective date 1614274 4.0 Limit of E.coli & Salmonella updated inline with DCM specification 06/11/2023 09:40:26 1606380 3.0 Test for specific surface added separately for vendor Peter Greven. 18/10/2023 08:54:30 1586083 2.0 Particle size : Method code is changed from M021046 to M021044 05/10/2023 17:19:50 1137835 1.0 made inline with DCM spec 25/07/2023 13:10:41 435060 NA New Document 10/03/2021 10:22:09\nGenerated By: (Mandeep Singh,E48311)\nGenerated Date : 30/01/2024 15:34:14\nThis document is generated electronically through LIMS.

Dry in an oven at 80 ºC to 90 ºC. Cool to room temperature in a desiccator and weigh. Mix thoroughly 10 g of sample with 100 mL of isopropyl alcohol. Pour through the screen in 3 or 4 portions, tapping the screen after each portion until screened.\nNote: \tUse a total of about 400 to 500 mL of isopropyl alcohol for the washing processes that follows. Continue to wash until no more fines appear to pass through sieve.\nWash the residue with isopropyl alcohol. Brush the residue gently through the screen with a camel’s hair brush. Wash the brush carefully with isopropyl alcohol taking care that no particles cling to the brush and that no loose hairs from the brush remain on the screen. Carefully clean off any sample particles adhering to the bottom rim of the sieve. Dry the screen and residue in an oven at 80 ºC to 90 ºC for 20 min. Cool to room temperature in desiccator and weigh.\nCalculate the percentage of sample that passed through the No. 325 sieve using the formula below.\nWX - WR\nPercentage passing through the No. 325 sieve = ----------- x 100\nWX Where\nWX = The sample weight in grams\nWR = The weight in grams of sample retained on the No. 325 sieve.\nHISTORY OF CHANGES\nCCR\nNumber Supersedes (Number and last version) Change(s) Made Effective date 1614274 4.0 Limit of E.coli & Salmonella updated inline with DCM specification 06/11/2023 09:40:26 1606380 3.0 Test for specific surface added separately for vendor Peter Greven. 18/10/2023 08:54:30 1586083 2.0 Particle size : Method code is changed from M021046 to M021044 05/10/2023 17:19:50 1137835 1.0 made inline with DCM spec 25/07/2023 13:10:41 435060 NA New Document 10/03/2021 10:22:09\nGenerated By: (Mandeep Singh,E48311)\nGenerated Date : 30/01/2024 15:34:14\nThis document is generated electronically through LIMS.
